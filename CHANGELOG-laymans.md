# What's New in v1.4.12

*Released: January 26, 2026*

---

## Overview

This is a maintenance release focused on improving our development security practices. **No user-facing changes** - community presets work exactly the same!

---

## What Changed?

### Better Security Scanning

We added automated tools that scan our code before it's published to:
- Detect if any passwords or API keys were accidentally included in the code
- Check for known security vulnerabilities in the libraries we use

This helps keep your preset data safe by catching potential issues before they reach production.

### Automated Dependency Updates

We set up Dependabot to automatically suggest updates for the libraries and tools we use. This means:
- Security patches get applied faster
- We stay current with bug fixes and improvements

## For Developers

*No action required on your part. Keep creating and sharing your dye presets!*
